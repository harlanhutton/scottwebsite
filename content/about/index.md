title: About Me
---
2024 J.D. Candidate @ Brooklyn Law School. Creative thinker with a tenacity for learning and passion for research and writing. Well-prepared for anticipating obstacles, collaborative problem solving, efficient communication, and attention to fine detail. Motivated to create innovative solutions to complex issues in transactional law environments. Particularly interested in intellectual property as it relates to copyright, music licensing, and e-book licensing.

Fun Facts:
Outside of law school, I am a multi-instrumental musician. I have toured across the country as a drummer for multiple bands and contributed to numerous recordings as a session musician. I am also an avid cyclist, recently taking up fixed gear biking around Manhattan and Brooklyn. A voracious reader and lifelong writer, I majored in English at Rhodes College and continue to write poetry and fiction as a hobby. I have a keen interest in the culture of sampling in underground hip-hop production, early 20th century American History, and the internet's influence on intellectual property and ownership.
